## About Me
My name is Mex (aka Zeo). I'm a freelance developer from the Netherlands with 4 years of experience. I started within the Game Modding (specifically Garry's Mod) community doing small to medium freelance projects. I however gradually shifted out of this and started doing Web Development which I'm currently passionate about. In terms of front- and backend development, I mainly prefer backend developer however I'm trying to get more familiar with frontend development to make this more pleasant for me.

**Databases:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis
